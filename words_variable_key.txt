sur_rate = Ambiguous faces percent negative ratings
hap_rate = Positive faces percent negative ratings
ang_rate = Negative faces percent negative ratings

amb_rate = Ambiguous scenes percent negative ratings
pos_rate = Positive scenes percent negative ratings
neg_rate = Negative scenes percent negative ratings

amw_rate = Ambiguous words percent negative ratings
pow_rate = Positive words percent negative ratings
new_rate = Negative words percent negative ratings

all_amb_rate = All ambiguous stimuli percent negative ratings
all_pos_rate = All positive stimuli percent negative ratings
all_neg_rate = All negative stimuli percent negative ratings

These all repeat for reaction time... then the ambiguous stimuli are broken down into RT for positive vs. negative ratings. 

Finally, there are some columns ending in "_bad" which flag participants with "bad" or inaccurate ratings in that stimulus category along with demographic variables.
